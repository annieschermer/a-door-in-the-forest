I drew cards for us, friends, and anyone you choose to pass this letter along to. I think I might start a blog soon and this letter is the first step. I imagined a red web touching everyone who might read this letter, those I know and those I donâ€™t. I thought and felt about this moment in time, today, this week, this month, and this season, and asked for cards that would help us and show us what we need to see. This is what I drew (photos attached) and my interpretations:

## Position 1 (left)
### The body, or the world, or our circumstances:
#### 5 of Wands Strife

This card speaks to the current state of strife! Anxiety comes as a result of uncertainty, and of energy held back. Many of us are prevented from working our regular jobs, yet our fear worry and anxiety prevent us from delving into creative projects or dreams or goals. Or perhaps our routines are similar but a general state of anxiety and strife pervades our outer and inner worlds.

It is important to find ways to release your energy and put it to use; and examine places where it gets stuck.

## Position 2 (center)
### The mind, our mental awareness, our choices
#### 4 of Wands, Completion and 2 of Swords, Peace.

The 4 of wands speaks to the need now for finishing what has been started, in order to create space for the new energies of spring (represented on the card by rams, symbols of Aries, the month we are entering today, and swallows). What must be drawn to a close, laid to rest, finished, in order for your energies to be freed for new possibilities?

The 2 of swords represents our need now for peace: in times of strife. Swords represent the mental plane of existence so this represents creating a space in which thoughts come to rest, instead of attacking your clarity (and sanity!) meditation of any kind, deep breathing, yoga, going for a walk, laughing, talking to a friend, even having a drink: find a way to give yourself the mental rest you need in order to heal and have space to operate at your best capacity.

## Position 3 (right)
### The spirit, or the higher self
#### 7 of wands Valour.

Now is the time to remember your true self. Now is the time to remember your deepest values. Now is the time to bring your unique gifts forward: not just the work you do for money, but the Work you are here to do in this world: as a lover, a healer, a care-er, a be-er; take the time to remember yourself. Re-align and stand firmly in the strength of your deepest and truest values.

Wands is the suit of energy and fire: creative, soulful, vital energy.

## BONUS card
### The Queen of Disks

Take care of yourself!!! Especially of your physical health. Eat as well as you can and drink fluids and be kind to your body. Make physical self-care a priority now, and honor yourself for the hard work you are doing, whether your hard work is getting out of bed, bathing, and eating; or caring for the sick, or building a house. Take care, take care, give love.

In summary: yes, this is a time of strife. Respond by tending to that which must be completed, and tending to your thoughts through active self-care, and tending to your health to clear space for your strongest self to emerge. We need us right now.

Thank you dear friends.

May you be well.

Love,

Annie
