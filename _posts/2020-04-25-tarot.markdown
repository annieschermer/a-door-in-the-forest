In my reading for you this new moon I pulled the following cards:

## 1. In the position of the body or the current physical reality;

We have, very appropriately for the earthy month of Taurus, the Princess of Disks: representing the earthiest aspect of disks (which are the suit representing earth).

The Princess of Disks is an incubator of new life: she is introspective and contemplative, and hella powerful. She tends to all her own needs, which fills her with the power to nurture new life (she is pregnant! What are you bearing or incubating right now? An actual child? An important new project? A new identity or way of being?).

## 2. In the position of mind, awareness, and our current focus/ choices, we have;

The Magus. This is a Major Arcana card, representing larger archetypal energies we move through in our lives. The Magus, associated with Mercury, represents mastery of all forms of communication including creative pursuits.

We also have the five of cups; disappointment. Fives are ruled by/ aspects of the Hierophant (V in the Major Arcana) which is affiliated with Taurus. What does disappointment have to teach us about ourselves and our desires? How can disappointment serve to guide us to our truest selves?

## 3. In the position of spirit we have the 3 of Disks, Works.

This means our highest selves, our bright-burning spirits, are calling for us to apply ourselves to those works in which we can utilize our full powers; in which our minds, bodies and spirits are all aligned and working toward the same end.

Supporting this process is The Moon, XVIII; One aspect of which is Authenticity, and initiation into the True Self. Perhaps this is a time of disillusionment, disenchantment, and revelation of authentic truths. Perhaps that is uncomfortable. And perhaps it can yield a truer self, a truer life built of truer works; works that spring from a ground of honesty, values, and our core beliefs.
