I visualized you, recipients of this message, and a red thread that became a web, connecting us and going out toward the other people that we all are connected to. Then I asked for cards to support and speak to that web, and this is what came up;

## Central/ core card
###XVIII The Moon! (I am not kidding.)

The moon has many layers of meaning; it is a card of initiation, and traditionally associated in the Tarot with illusion and deception. However the moon is also a mirror for the sun’s light, as the Tarot is a mirror for your own soul (or Jung might say your own subconscious; however you like to think of it). Mirrors can show us even what we do not wish to see. Therefore the moon is also a card of AUTHENTICITY representing initiation into the journey toward your truest Self. Scary! Exciting! The gate of the full moon is open now, and through it comes support for revealing the truth of the current moment, as we wish to see it, and also what we wish to deny. (The full moon’s light lets you cast a shadow, even at night! What is hiding in your shadow? What gifts and what challenges and what wounds are you spending your energy trying to keep hidden?)

## Position 1
### The Body, or the circumstance
#### 4 of Wands, Completion

We are in the solar month of Aries, which coincides with the spring, and new beginnings. Take stock of what needs to be brought to completion: and take stock of what has been completed, what is ending. Beginnings and endings go hand in hand. What is beginning now? What is ending?

The four of wands speaks to wholeness and the process of individuation. The initiation process supported by XVIII the Moon begins with this.

What needs to be completed in order to move forward in wholeness?

(At the new moon this card was in the central position, of Mind. I promise I shuffled real well. It has now moved leftward into the Body; from thought into action.)

## Position 2
### The Mind, or our awareness, or our choices
#### 4 of Disks, Power

This card visually reminds me of holing up, restricting the flow both in and out of our inner sanctuaries, homes, castles. Another way to say this is having boundaries; we protect and nurture our power through our ability to set limits and boundaries. When we are able to truly care for ourselves, our own inner castle/ domain, then we operate from a place of our own strength and power. Only then can we empower others. There is also a bit of a caution here about becoming too rigid, or too isolated; note the narrow road leading through the walls of the fortress; remember to allow some flow both in and out, within your well-defined boundaries.


## Position 3
### The Spirit, or the higher self
#### The Prince of Disks

Remember in the new moon letter, when I mentioned what kind of world do we want to build? Well, the prince of disks is known as the World Builder. Grounded and solid yet in motion with the aid of a bull-drawn chariot (the bull representing Taurus and the ability to manifest the beauty and bounty of your inner world in concrete and tangible forms) the Prince of Disks makes shit happen. He is surrounded by the seeds and floral shapes that are his intentions, visions, world, coming into being. And we are him!

The invitation of the spirit/ higher self, is to take care now of your body. Disks represent the physical world. Get good exercise. Your body is powerful; let it be powerful. Let yourself move and express the strength of your body.

We have a world to build!
