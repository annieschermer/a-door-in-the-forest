What a glorious full moon! I saw it rising just over the hills this (yesterday!) evening, huge and golden.

I don’t know that much about astrology. But, from what I know, Libra is all about balance and harmony, as well as relationship and collaboration. In tarot, Libra is connected with Major Arcana card VIII, known as Justice/ Adjustment. Which brings up the question,

What needs to come into balance for you right now?

In America we have this myth about individualism; that being self-sufficient is good and that relying on others is in some way a sign of weakness, of un-adultness, or of deficiency. That myth makes it very extra scary to rely on others, to be vulnerable, to ask for help. It opens us up to all kinds of potential to be hurt. But usually when there is the potential to be hurt there is also the potential to…yep…GROW.

So…

What does collaboration look like for you right now?

Are there any areas in your life in which reaching out to someone, perhaps to ask for or to offer help, might lead to growth?

Who or what shows you the truth?

Some questions I am asking myself right now:

*What can you let go of, in order to be the person you really want to be, and do the work you really want to do?*

*WHO can help you in this journey?*

*Who supports you in being your truest self?*

*Who has skills that you don’t have (yet) that you need in order to be who you want to be?*

*Who or what balances you?*

## Invitation to a Full Moon Ritual

I know, the full moon was last night. But I read somewhere that back in the day, the full moon was actually felt/ celebrated/ honored over a three day span. Which makes sense: it’s really bright and full for more than just one day.

The full moon is the chance to see in full light in the middle of the night. A chance for the inner secrets and that which is usually hidden, to come to light. It is a time when the manifestations of the new moon are taking shape. Time to see what can be seen, to clarify your direction and re-focus, and prepare to release that which needs to be released.

It is also, for me, usually a semi-intense time, when I need extra self-care. I don’t sleep as well, and I tend to feel less grounded, and more agitated or uneasy. So, I suggest if you are like me, remembering self care, and doing what you can to get centered and care for yourself. Deep breathing whenever you think of it (a full exhale is an important part of deep breathing) and a grounding walk outside may be helpful. I like to take off my shoes and stand on the ground…to get grounded…Or any kind of rest: whatever you need to rest and integrate the swirly large energies and increased intensity of full moon times.

### So, the ritual

Moongaze, if you can. I think moonrise was around 8pm from where I stood tonight; just after sundown. Just gaze at the moon and bask in its light as it rises, or anytime at all. You may try opening your palms to the moon, removing some or all of your clothes to absorb the moonlight into your skin, or just letting your eyes feast on the beauty of the light. Poets and artists and all types of folk have been inspired by the moon for ages so they can’t be wrong. She has things to tell us and we hear them by moongazing. (or he apparently if you are Lithuanian, or Nepali; probably some other places masculinize the moon instead of feminize. Go with your feeling.)

Lift your hands to the moon, and open your mouth wide. Inhale or drink, as if you are ingesting some of the moonlight. Notice any sensations (imaginary sensations DO COUNT)

Place things in the moonlight that you want to charge up with the full moon’s burgeoning bounties. Your crystals and oracular tools, your bowl of clear water to use for your medicines and healings, your special doll, your talismans, maybe your musical instrument (just don’t leave it outside alone for very long. Bonus points if you PLAY your musical instrument in the light of the full moon).
Soon the moon will be on the wane again: perhaps the only thing illuminated for you right now is all the crap you want to release. That’s fine. The full moon is a great time for releasing. You might want to write down or otherwise represent the concepts, ideas, constructs, constraints, burdens, etc. that you need to release. You might want to write them on paper and burn them tonight. Or perhaps you want to release more gradually: as the moon wanes, feel their influence wane; and just before the new moon you can burn or otherwise release.
