Hello Friends,

Welcome to our last new moon of spring. Outside in the woods, the leaves have unfurled and are deepening into their summer shades. Many of the ephemeral wildflowers of spring are already shifting their focus from blossoming to the production of seeds: petals falling away. Apples and other trees have been fertilized by the motion of pollinators and now tiny fruits begin to swell.

For me, this invites a questioning around what it is I am deciding to nurture, to commit to, to invest in.

How have the seeds planted deep in the winter given way to the flowers of spring? What fruits are now taking form? What is required now to nurture those fruits, to ensure a plentiful harvest?

A very important aspect of harvest and abundance is the practice of thinning. In orchards at this time of year, trees are thinned of many would-be apples to allow space for the most robust fruit to grow to its maximum potential in size and flavor. Many other plants are also thinned at this time. Since the air sign month of Gemini is associated with communication and ideas, I am thinking about thinning in terms of ideas and projects.

Thinning, in the garden and any area of life, is challenging for me. It is hard not to feel sad for the little plants or ideas or projects that need to get pulled in order to make space and focus on the bigger ones. But, sometimes thinnings, whether they are plant starts or ideas or projects, can be replanted elsewhere or given away to friends. Sometimes they can be eaten, or composted to nurture the plants that remain. And remember; the process of death and life go hand in hand. The purpose of thinning is to insure the greatest growth; the greatest harvest.

*What needs to be thinned right now? Are there overcrowded areas of your life that would benefit from a little extra breathing room?*

*What is most important to you right now? What projects, relationships, and ideas are most worthy of your focus and attention?*

## New Moon Tarot Reading

Gemini is all about relationships. Be it relationship to self, lover, friend, twin, or anyone, the bread and butter of relationships is communication.

And so in the position of the body/ the world/ the circumstance, we have 8 of Wands, Swiftness. This is the card for clear communication, which has the power to clear away obstacles. I think of all creativity as varying forms of communication. What is the quality of your communication like right now? In the context of self, projects, relationships, others?

In the position of the mind/ awareness/ choices we have two cards: XI Lust, and 8 of Disks, Prudence. A lot of eights, no? Well see the notes below on the 8 of Swords for a wee bit more detail. Together these cards remind us that when order and harmony are present, harvest is yielded. When we put our ability to create order, harmony and structure in service of that which ignites our passion, we achieve SUCCESS but first, we have to battle a demon:

The Seven of Swords, Futility. There are thirteen Bardo or Beast states in the Thoth tarot deck. This is one of them. This is self-sabotage; negative thinking that cuts into our clarity of focus and vision, making it hard to have faith in what we are doing and see the clear way forward. So, with all this talk about thinning and growth and harvest, ask yourself, what is it that you want the most? What touches you on the deepest level? What are you so afraid of not getting that you might protect yourself right out of even trying for it? In what areas do you most fear failure? Are you fully facing that fear? Are you trying anyway?

And yes once we have faced our self-sabotaging nature in the Beast state of the seven of swords, we move into the

Six of disks, Success. I hardly think I need to elaborate much here, except to say perhaps it would be useful to spend a little time reflecting on what true success looks and feels like to you. What does abundance look and feel like? How do you know you have achieved success in your life? Are your definitions of success aligned with your true values, or are they aligned with projections from outer sources that do not connect or resonate with you? Are you experiencing tension around this dichotomy? Can ye release some of it?

Additional Fun Tarot Notes from my (Crowley/ Harris Thoth) tarot deck.

There are several tarot cards associated with the month of Gemini, and many of them center around opportunities to release restrictive and limiting patterns of thought:

The eight of swords, Interference, is associated with Jupiter in Gemini, and refers to destructive thought patterns that undermine your clarity. Eight is the number of Adjustment or Justice in the Major Arcana; so remember to return to or seek out objectivity in situations of conflict and obstructed communication. Wait for clarity before making important decisions. When clarity is not present, why not try a little thinning…

The nine of swords, Cruelty, is associated with Mars in Gemini. This card is primarily about self-cruelty; those thoughts which we use (often unconsciously) against ourselves; cruel thoughts which undermine our peace and happiness. The Hermit is the major arcana archetype which can help to heal self-cruelty; introspection and true self-contemplation can yield the deep forgiveness we are seeking from ourselves.

And finally the ten of swords, Ruin, associated with the sun in Gemini, represents the fear of ruination in areas of your life that hold great meaning for you. This is a scary card for me and one I will be working with especially this month. In that vein, I offer an invitation to a ritual around the release of fear, and the acceptance and trust in expansion and positive change. The Wheel of Fortune is the major arcana archetype to assist with the release of fear and the expansion into fortunate change.

In my own meditations on the concept of ruin, I find myself thinking about the heart, pictured at the center of the card. And my own heart, which I often curl protectively around, hunching my shoulders, causing all sorts of problems for my neck and head and spine. This soft but incredibly tough core of feeling and sensation, and how much of my life has been spent in attempting to protect it from harm, only to realize that even in that protection, sometimes harm is done. How can we be vulnerable and safe at the same time? Who (and which aspects of self) is/ are being protected by our actions, words, inactions? Who is harmed?

## The Gemini new moon ritual

It is already the waxing crescent; the seed energies of this moon are already unfurling, showing the first bright coils of their vital forms.

I have held back from releasing this letter because I have not had clear ideas for ritual suggestions this month. So, I am going to release it anyway, in current form. Perhaps the ritual invitation is to do some

### Thinning, or weeding
#### And while thinning plants in the garden, say some thanks to the ones getting pulled up or snipped, gratitude for their life force which will be recycled in the nutrient system. Reflect on what you need to weed out or thin in your life.

## Additionally,

How can we better communicate the fullness of ourselves in our relationships and our lives? Reflecting on the dual nature of the Twins; what sides of ourselves do we hold back out of fear? How can we release fear and surrender to trust? (I don’t know. Anybody have a good idea about this?)

I need some extra courage this month, for an ongoing project of overcoming fear to be more honest with myself and the people in my life. So far it is extremely hard and also rewarding. So perhaps a ritual for this kind of courage;

Go outside, preferably under the light of the waxing moon.
Let the moon’s light shine on your heart. Feel the space in and around your heart, and let the moonlight shine there for awhile.
Remind yourself of who you are. Remember the strength it has taken to come to this point in your life; not just your own strength, but all the people that lived and worked to bring you here. Appreciate their gifts and sacrifices, and your own.
Let the moon be a true mirror for the true self that lives inside you. See yourself reflected in the light and the shadow of the moon.
Test your courage by speaking the truth. Try it with trusted friends. When you hear (or say) something that grates against the heart, pause, and give voice to your heart, even if the words are uncertain. It could be as simple as, “That does not feel true for me.” And then try to say something that is. How else can we build a better and truer world?
