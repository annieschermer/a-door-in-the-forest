Happy new moon, friends.

We have entered the moon of Taurus. Spring is fully underway; seeds planted are sprouting and gaining strength in the light and motion of spring.

Taurus is all about the body; physicality, possessions, self-care, money, abundance; I think it’s going to be a good month.

How can you more fully embody your deepest and truest Self, offering the best of your gifts to your life? How can working within your field of happiness increase your abundance both in terms of the energy and joy you have to give to yourself and others and in material gain? What small, practical shifts can you make toward the life that you believe in? How can you maintain the momentum of these shifts (structures, accountability, collaboration)?

I’ve been thinking about the idea of True Work. What is the work we do that calls to us most deeply? What is the most important work of our lives?

Taurus is an earth sign, in contrast to fiery Aries which we have just moved through. So now is a time to anchor all the energy and momentum of the past month in practical, grounded form.

One simple and direct way to do this is through grounding and embodiment. Standing outside on the ground, especially in bare feet; taking deep breaths; any form of exercise, especially when it is undertaken mindfully; taking a hot bath or shower; going for a hike; you get the idea. Get outside, get into your body, do it often. Our bodies are ourselves, and they are our lives here and now. There’s so much magic and potential in the transience of our human experience; we have this one moment of our lives, this one body, with which to move and act and be. So honor your body, listen to its messages, attend to its needs. Our bodies have things to teach us; the cells of our bodies were grown from the substance of this earth just like every tree and droplet of water, carried through the well-worn channels of our ancestors and lineages. Our bodies store memories and information; they pull and call us and respond to and reflect our inner and outer realities and experiences.

Surely if we are questing for deep ancestral knowledge, perhaps estranged by years or generations of disconnection from body, land, family, homeland, ancestors; our bodies, which began as eggs inside the bodies of our grandmothers, whose bodies in turn began inside the bodies of their grandmothers, and so on; surely these bodies hold that knowledge.

The invitation this month, is to take extra care. Pay extra attention. Know your body, know yourself.

On the topic of ancestry and lineage; I have been uncovering some bitter roots inside myself this month. Personally I have been working with and examining and trying to heal internalized patterns of oppression. As a woman, and as the offspring of recovering Christians, one way this plays out for me is a martyrdom complex which has a twisted sort of reward system even though it is a major obstacle to true self-love and self-care!

I have recently had conversations with several different friends about a feeling of guilt and judgment surrounding how we spend our days (especially in this strange time when many of us have significantly shifted our daily routine and reality). In most cases, the judgment is internal, but we project it onto others, dreading that they are as cruel and harsh as we are.

My dear friend and creative collaborator Channing Showalter put it very well, saying, “My mind and perceptions are majorly colonized by the Christian turned capitalist list of do’s and don’ts…How can we let go of what we think we are supposed to be doing, and do what we truly feel called to do?”

## Here are some of my questions right now:

*How can we release toxic patterns and habits, especially when they are carried/ have been carried by the culture, our families, or both?*

*How do we personally embody toxic patterns?*

*How can we reform new patterns, especially when we see these toxic patterns continuing to be embodied by those around us?*

*How can we as empathetic social beings, inspire and uplift each other by refusing to carry on toxic and unhealthy patterns?*

*How can we forgive ourselves?*

*How can we forgive our lineages, our families, our ancestors?*

*On the flip side, what strengths can we celebrate from our individual lineages, and our culture? How can we embody the gifts that come from them, while releasing what must be released? (for example, celebrating true generosity, while releasing toxic martyrdom?)*

The invitation to an experiment of ritual this new moon is focused on cleansing and release, grounding and embodiment, celebration of beauty

## 1. Purification, release and cleansing.

Go to a place of water. This could be the shower or bath, a stream, a barrel or bowl of rainwater, the sea…

Greet the water. Ask permission to approach, and to commune, with the water. Thank the water.

Take some time to summon up what needs to be cleansed and released. (Releasing is a process. It’s ok if you released something last month and it still needs to be released.)

Bathe yourself in the water. Let the water wash you and carry away your dead skin cells and the ideas and constructs and toxins that need to be carried away. Thank the water.

Depending on what you are releasing, you may want to carry stones into the water, holding and carrying and then releasing them as you let them hold and carry your burden.

Or, you may want to tear strips of cloth, and tie them to a tree near a special place of water, representing both what is being released, and what you are wishing to carry forward.

Or, you may want to write some things for release on paper, and let them go in the water.

Use your intuition and pay attention. Listen.

## 2. Celebration of Beauty and Abundance


Invite beauty and abundance into your life by honoring it. Honor your own love beauty; take time to notice what you find beautiful, and bask in it. Breathe beautiful smells, look at beautiful things,


Make a shrine in your home somewhere, or freshen up an existing shrine. Incorporate elements which you find personally beautiful. If you live with someone else, make sure you have a personal space, however small, for your own private declarations of beauty and pleasure. (You can make another one collaboratively if you want!)


## 3. Honoring Lineage and Ancestors

Express gratitude for at least one thing that comes from your ancestral lineage. Think about your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, as far back as you can. Did they pass on strong bones? Fortitude? A knack for gardening? You may have several but even one is enough. Thank your ancestors for this gift. Find something to represent the gift(s) or write them down on a piece of paper and place them on your altar/ shrine.

Enjoy. Explore. Use your intuition and pay attention. Listen.
