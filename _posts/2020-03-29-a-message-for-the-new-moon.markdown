Dear friends,

This time of forced enclosure makes my mind turn inward. Inward is, for many of us, a very frightening direction to turn; especially in times of great uncertainty and worry. Modern life with all its stimulus seems to discourage the turning inward and provides many alternatives. Facing ourselves can be very painful: but if undertaken with gentleness, care and humor, it can be very healing. We can discover our selves and aspects of ourselves that are lost or locked-out, lonely and frightened. We can welcome ourselves back, gather our missing pieces, assemble ourselves and move onward in wholeness.

This strange and sometimes scary time of social isolation is offering me some perspective, and helping me to see some of the ways in which I envision a different world from the one I have created or perpetuated through my daily actions and inactions.

I am taking this opportunity to shed a crusty, old, too-tight skin. To attempt to reconstruct a system of value based on love: to remember what is important and to re-focus.

Here are some questions emerging for me in this time:

*What is the world we want?*

*What is the world we long to live in?*

*Who are the people who will build this world?*

*(What does it take to become those people?)*

To that end I am trying an experiment, and issuing an invitation. It’s a two-parter.

I think a lot about culture, tradition, ritual, its role in my life and the areas in which I feel a lack of ritual, of acknowledged sacredness or of marking important moments. I think about my ancestors many generations back, about the many diverse lineages I descend from, and I wonder about their lives and relationships to self, family, home, land, the divine. For me this questioning has always been private and internal, and I am now taking the step of bringing the quest and question into the outer world.

The invitation is to a rite of spring, in honor of this being the first new moon of spring; the birth of a new season.

Spring in the Northern Hemisphere is a time of possibility, of new growth. The world is warming and our bodies are waking up. We are about to stir into the light season, a phase of great activity. How can we direct our energies in the coming season in service of our own truest beliefs? Are there old skins to shed: are there blockages to your vital and creative energy that need to be addressed? Are you holding yourself back? What is deeply important right now?

The spring ritual I offer is a simple one of shedding and rebirth.

## Part One
### Calling of the shadow and cleansing of the obstructions. Grieving what has been lost and laying Winter’s dead to rest.

First designate a space. Call yourself there. Make yourself comfortable. Invite your shadow. I suggest lighting a candle. You may want to lay branches or leaves around you in a circle. Be creative and respond to your impulses. Be as elaborate or as simple as you like.
Reflect on anything that was lost this winter; anything that needs to be grieved, or released. Reflect on constructs of personality or of culture that are harmful to your growth and healing. (I personally struggle often with a variety of perfectionism that often leaves me creatively blocked and felling stifled, held back and voiceless in the world. I am working it now.)
Find or Create an object to represent what is being released. It could be as simple as a piece of paper with a word or words written on it, as elaborate as a lantern or a doll or a black feather; stones gathered, fallen leaves, a drawing.
Hold and then release. Bury, burn, set out to sea, flush down the toilet (only if it’s written on toilet paper J).

## Part Two
### Welcoming the Spring

Now you are free to lighten up and have a little fun.

Go outside, if you aren’t there already. (Ideally you would have done part one at night, all night, in a cave on a hillside and then at dawn emerged for part two but whatever works.)
Look at the signs of spring: you may have been noticing them all along. From my window I have seen the steady return of Robins and Varied Thrushes and heard their chiming calls, and enjoyed the sunlight coming through the thin spring-green leaves and dripping white blossoms of Wild Plum. Nettles are pressing up from the forest floor; the leaves of bleeding hearts and other ephemerals herald the flowers that will come soon. Enjoy the spring; observe the buds. Taste them. Dance and sing. Honor the blossoms; this blossom-time is so special and fleeting. What is blossoming inside you now?
This is a time when it would be good to dance in a circle, and to have something to sing together. For now our circles are stretched, but they are still whole, even as we sit far apart from each other. Dance and sing and know you are not the only one. I will do it too. If you can’t sing for/with a friend, sing for/with a tree. And if you get worried or embarrassed just remember like a gift for a friend, this work is not really about you. The world needs us to dance and sing. The trees need our music and to know we love and see them, just as we need to be loved and seen, just as we need the trees to shade us and give us breath. So get over yourself, and sing for a tree.
On this the first New Moon of spring, let’s all take a moment to look up into the sky, to feel the spring coming, bringing fresh energy, new life, warmth and growth to the ground and to us on it.

May our work be anchored in our hearts. May we act in service to our deepest values. May we honor ourselves, each other, and the land and home we all share in every action we take and choice we make.


Happy spring my friends.

Love,

Annie

## P.S.

What is the world we want? What is the world we long to live in? Who are the people who will build this world? (Hint: It is us.) What does it take to become those people? To become ourselves?
